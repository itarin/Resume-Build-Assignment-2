      JS Promises
    </h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is single threaded which means that functions run one at a time. This means that functions run one after the other. When one function is running it will delay whatever function comes afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their must basic promises are like event listeners except
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or fail twice, neither can it switch from success to failure or vice versa.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a promise has succeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback, the correct callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is very useful for success and failure in asynchrnoicity because there you are most interested in reacting to an outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      A promise can be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fullfilled - The action related to the promise succeeded.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rejected - The action relating to the promise failed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pending - Hasn't fullfilled or rejected.
      </li>
      <li>
        Settled - Has fullfilled or rejected.
      </li>
    </ul>
